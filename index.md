# Test Blog Entry
### 3/11/2021

Decided to redirect my domain name from LinkedIn to GitHub Pages to try to add some content. I've been working on a handful of projects, so this would probably be a more _useful_ page to share what I'm doing. 

The initial commit was broken because the basic template that I chose was not supported by GitHub pages. So this commit is using the "minimal" theme from GitHub, and I'll build it from here.

Looking forward to playing around in a text editor again and seeing what comes out of it!
